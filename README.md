# LEITunes

Project related to the course DCO (Desenho Centrado em Objetos) involving OOP.
This project consists of a music library that allows its users to play and organize songs in playlists and categories.

The interface for this was provided by the teachers so the project itself revolved around using different design patterns in JAVA to reproduce the features asked by the teacher.

To run the project import it to Eclipse and run the GUIClient.java file.

Final Grade: 17.2 / 20
